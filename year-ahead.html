      <p>
        Hey love
      </p>
      <p>
        Having tried to do the 12 days of us and messing it up, and then having started
        on a different theme, this now marks my 3rd attempt at what should have otherwise
        been an idea so cute that it would be hard to mess it up at all, much less twice!
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet here we are - dare I say it - feeling better. Feeling like a really hard
        stretch for us is on its way out and more fun is on the way. I know its not gone
        and that I can't undo the hurt I caused you or have us forget my lying to you, although
        I'd do just about anything to do that, if it were possible. It's hard for me to believe
        that I essentially took 7 weeks of our relationship and turned them into a really
        tough time for both of us, but especially for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past 21 months you have brought me more joy than I think you could possibly
        understand, and I can't imagine you bringing me any less than that in the next 21, or the
        21 after that. Unfortunately the same can't be said for me. It sounds like I'm just
        being hard on myself blah blah, but if you stop to think about it then you'll see its
        true. I've tried to love you as best I can, but too many times my best hasn't been good
        enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's to the third iteration of this present: Exciting things for 2019. Five that I'm
        looking forward to, and four that I want to do better. You deserve a better boyfriend than
        you've had and I think it can be me but I can't risk not trying each day to be a better
        version of myself for you. After all, you make me feel like my favorite, purest version
        of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this list might feel short and the explanations may not be as thorough as you would hope.
        I get that. I know how much you liked the idea of the original present especially while we
        were going through that hard time, and I see how happy you are anytime I say that I've been
        working on this. I want you to feel that happiness all the time and so I've tried to make this
        as good and yet as real of a present as possible. I think the honest truth is that this project
        never having been finished has left me feeling like this part of me is still stuck in that hard
        place for us. In a way I feel like I deserve to feel some of that when you're not feeling it (since
        the opposite was too often true before), but I also feel like having finished the project is
        unbelievably liberating, since now nothing seems to directly bring me back to that place. I love you
        and I want to feel able to, not forget that experience, but to move on from it and to start enjoying
        and enacting the things talked about here. I can't begin to tell you how much I adore you and how
        excited I am to get to work on the REAL present here - which is a personal website for you to design,
        build, and show off to people! So, without further adue, here are some things for this year...
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Improvements">
      <div class="transparent title">
        <h1>Improvements</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="main_content">
        <h2>Impressing You</h2>
        <p>
          I know I often joke that I don’t need to be presentable or impress anyone since I’m with you, and it can be easy to fall into that mindset, but I know that its important to always make you feel special. Even just watching the middle aged guys in Queer Eye that act single is enough for me to see how that looks from the outside and want to make a change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing drastic, of course, but trying to wear better clothes or keep my room cleaner, etc. Even little things like keeping my hair in decent shape and remembering deodorant, all the way up to dressing better. At the end of the day you’re special to me and I’ll never be able to make you feel the way I did when we first fell for each other, but that’s not an excuse not to try.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Meds</h2>
        <p>
          Short sweet but important! If it’s really going to be ‘you and me’ then you have to help me remember my Flintstones and I should be thinking of your med schedule as if it were my own. I’ve already tried to be better these past couple of weeks and I hope to continue to do so. I know it can often be the small things that leave the biggest impression and especially with the news of this specialist coming into the mix I know the mere idea of the meds can be daunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you’re on them for life I’m still going to be doing my best to help you remember. There can even be gut punches involved for BC.
        </p>
        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <p>
          There are also a lot of things that I’m coming to understand we view really differently. It’s been no surprise that relationships take effort and I think we’ve always been good at working to make ours so good. That said, we are very different people in ways that I’m still coming to appreciate. In our time in Thailand your friend group was the guys and you were 1000% comfortable with them. It would’ve been hard at that point to imagine you being really scared to introduce yourself to people and act extroverted - and as you know I’m quite the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are plenty of things like this where I’m still working to understand the way we deal with tasks and situations, and the first one that comes to mind is planning. There are very few things in life that I will plan extensively for (as you’ve come to see), and travel is certainly one of those things. In an absolutely perfect world for me I would wake up, decide what to do on that day and that day alone, and then I’d go to sleep and repeat that the following day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve already gone over the issue of planning visits out over the span of a week or so, and I think that’s going better, but I know you focus much more than I do on the future so you end up doing a lot of the planning for things that we do together. I don’t like reaching the point at which I’d start planning a trip (say, one week before we leave for Portugal) only to find that you’ve planned the whole trip without any help from me. Be It something that big or just random time we have together I can’t promise to always plan stuff because that would probably drive me crazy lol, but I really will work to be better at doing my half of the planning if nothing else.
        </p>
        <h2>Presents</h2>
        <p>
          Another area where we are clearly different is present-giving and holiday planning. I think presents are nice but, and I don’t know exactly why, to me they haven’t always been very important. I certainly like getting them and giving them feels nice, but I think there are other ways to prove you care that don’t involve presents. I know you don’t disagree with that at all, but I think you like giving them more and so you’ll do all of your shopping in November and I’ll do mine after final exams end on December 18th or whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of having this as an improvement is simply that I’ll make an effort to do better to go outside my normal comfort zone and routine to try and put an emphasis on presents in a way I otherwise wouldn’t. This past Christmas having bought the ring I was planning on smaller stuff but I was super surprised to find that I had actually only given you a couple small things. I do love giving them to you and to other people and so I’ll be working to try and avoid a situation like that in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="LookForward">
      <div class="transparent title">
        <h1>Exciting Things</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="main_content">
        <h2>Portugal</h2>
        <p>
          I know I’ve already talked about how I never plan things, but it’s not because I don’t get excited for trips like this. I can already imagine the excitement of packing! Just kidding that’s the least exciting part. Having the vacation start as soon as we get to the airport will be a great feeling and I’m sure we’ll be cranky by the time we hit our 4th airport on the way over, but getting to the AirBnb in Porto will make it all worth it. Whatever it is that we plan for the entire week I just know I’ll be happy exploring with you and not needing to worry about work like I did with the swim club in Thailand last year. If I work out a part-time arrangement with SelfKey I’ll be sure to ask about taking that week off and I can’t possibly imagine them saying no.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jet lag won’t be as bad as it was last year and so we’ll do some napping but I also hope we get to do plenty of little explores for meals or activities that we find or hear about (or have planned). There will be so many exciting things, but in general I think last year’s spring break was different because we were long distance and this was time together. Now I’m excited to feel the relaxation now that we’re used to a busy life together in Boston.
        </p>
        <h2>Finding a Home</h2>
        <p>
          Yes I’m looking forward to living together - as you’ll soon read - but before that can happen we need to agree on a place to coexist, and I think that process is exciting in itself! It’s always fun to ‘play grown-up’ and I don’t know if that feeling ever goes away, but either way looking for homes certainly falls into that category for me. It’s been fun to do it for almost a year at this point, and I think it will continue to serve as a fun way to manifest our plans for our future together. I know that the place itself won’t matter nearly as much as the life we live in it, but I still hope to find a really special place that we both agree is “the right place” for us.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Living Together</h2>
        <p>
          This feels like something where I have everything to say and nothing to say all at the same time. There are so many things that I’m looking forward to in terms of us living together that it would feel almost silly to try to mention them all. The idea of coexisting feeling normal is incredibly exciting. Having you in Boston has felt amazing, but it still feels like when I’m at your place or you’re at mine we should be doing things together. Of course I love doing stuff together, but feeling like we can always be together while doing some of our own stuff and some together stuff feels like the ultimate goal so I’m excited to think that we could be doing that this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some parts, like sharing a bathroom or a bed, will be entirely unexciting since we’re used to that. On the other hand, making and eating lots of meals together will be new and exciting, as will coming and going to different things from the same place. More than anything I think spending time together without feeling like the spending of time together is something we’re busy doing will be a really nice mental change.
        </p>
        <h2>Learning Thai With You</h2>
        <p>
          There are so many things that I want to do for their own sake that have really no relation to my necessities that I often lose track and make little progress on them. I feel like I could spend a month exclusively working on building a guitar, or a month learning the capitals of the world, or a year studying to really learn Thai. Too many cool things that have nothing to do with school that I want to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, the point is that if we’re in Chiang Mai then I don’t have schoolwork and Thai moves to the forefront of these miscellaneous things to learn since it’ll be an important part of everyday life. Even things like labeling everything in our apartment like that guy suggested at the super bowl viewing party 2 years ago. However we end up deciding to do it I’m excited that I can do it with you.
        </p>
        <h2>Holidays</h2>
        <p>
          Your love for the holidays is easy to make fun of, and it deserves to be made fun of, but nonetheless I like the idea of us being together for the holiday season. Even if we’re not in our home for the holidays themselves, I know you’ll start celebrating in late September so rest-assured we’ll have a few months to spend together feeling festive. This is definitely another area in which we are fundamentally different since the holidays are essentially just regular days for me. I’m excited to be living with you and have some of the spirit rub off on me!
